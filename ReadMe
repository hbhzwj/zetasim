This distribution contains codes of ZetaSim, a NS2 simualtion suite
for Zeta Protocol Simualtion. In addition, some demos are provided,
which can be found in ./P2P/demo
More detail on most of the methods 
can be found in the paper 
Zeta: A Novel Network Coding Based P2P Downloading Protocol, Jing Wang.
You can get the paper in directory ./P2P/doc

This distribution consists of the following files:

*************
* ATTENTION!*
*************
Current Verion of ZetaSim is NOT a full implementation of Zeta Protcol.
    1. It doesn't implement flow control
    2. Boot Server Will always return itself as tracker.
    3. Don't support generation. Files are directly cutted into blocks.
All THESE PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED IN LATER VERSION.

Since I am only a undergraduate student and Zeta Protocol is not a mature protocol. 
I cannot ensure that there is no problem in Protocol Design or Simulation
Suite Implementation. Be careful when you decide to use Zeta Protocol 
or ZetaSim.
